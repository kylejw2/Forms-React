1. What techniques can you use to help you translate raw HTML into React? 
    Perhaps the most straight forward technique to translate raw HTML into React, or JSX, is by returning/rendering it through a React component.
2. In what way can you think about the HTML building blocks that will help you build React forms? 
    I think about the HTML building blocks as nodes on a tree. Applying this to React forms, this allows me to build a structured React form.
3. What resources are shared between HTML and React? 
    All of the HMTL tags are shared between HTML and React but not all React tags are HTML tags. This is because JSX is a type of XML, which allows us to create our own unique tags.
